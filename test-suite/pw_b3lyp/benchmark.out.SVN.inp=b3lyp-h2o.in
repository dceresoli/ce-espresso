     Serial version
     Reading input from b3lyp-h2o.in

     Current dimensions of program PWSCF are:
     Max number of different atomic species (ntypx) = 10
     Max number of k-points (npk) =  40000
     Max angular momentum in pseudopotentials (lmaxx) =  3

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation      = B3LYP ( 7 12  9  7 0 0)
     EXX-fraction              =        0.20
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want


     gamma-point specific algorithms are used
EXX: grid of k+q points same as grid of k-points
