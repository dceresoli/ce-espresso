This is a code that solves a model Hamiltonian of strongly correlated states 
within Dynamical Mean Field Theory. Model Hamiltonian in Wannier functions 
basis is produced by postprocessing utility from QE (4.1CVS version).

The code strongly depends on Quantum-ESPRESSO.
To build the code one needs:
-parallel environment
-LAPACK and BLAS libraries
-configured QE distribution (at least version 4.1CVS)

Installation instruction:
- copy whole dmft directory into the root directory of QE distribution
- cd dmft
- make
- executable files qmc.x, dmft.x, mix.x, maxent.x wil appear in ../bin
  subdirectory.
